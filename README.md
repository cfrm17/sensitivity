# sensitivity
Risk sensitivities, also referred to as Greeks, are the measure of a financial instrumentâ€™s value reaction to changes in underlying factors. The value of a financial instrument is impacted by many factors, such as interest rate, stock price, implied volatility, time, etc. Sensitivities are risk measures that are more important than fair values.
